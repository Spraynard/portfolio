# portfolio
This has all of the files that I have currently made for my portfolio site.

How it works:
1. Node.js Runtime
 - MySQL Database
2. Express.js Web Framework
 - PUG (Formerly Jade) Templates for pages
 - Uses SASS for styling
3. jQuery Client Side JavaScripts

Things to add:
1. More Comprehensive Cacheing?
2. Possibility to use front-end framework
3. ImageMagick to automatically optimize images when I add them with a project
4. Complete login system (but for what reason!? :3)

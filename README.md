# portfolio
This has all of the files that I have currently made for my portfolio site.

How it works:
1. Node.js Runtime
   - MySQL Database
2. Express.js Web Framework
   - PUG (Formerly Jade) Templates for pages
   - Uses SASS for styling
3. jQuery Client Side JavaScripts

Things to add:
1. Refactor "projectEdit.js" to be more like "postEdit.js".
2. More Comprehensive Cacheing?
3. Possibility to use front-end framework
4. ImageMagick to automatically optimize images when I add them with a project
5. Complete login system (but for what reason!? :3)
